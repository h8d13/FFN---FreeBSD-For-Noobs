## Distributions

We talk of ditributions but each distro has it's own releases types:
Often broken down into: 

Architecture Type & Installation type

Architectures > Processors
```
amd64
i386
aarch64
armv7
powerpc
powerpc64
powerpc64le
powerpcspe
riscv64

Might also include specific, Netboot Images, VM Images, SD Card Images, etc
``` 

While the installation type is often the contents itself: `Minimal, server, desktop, live environment, ...` 
Hence why it's important to go some do some research for the type of project you are aiming to achieve. 

> Hint : Look at the sizes of the installers they can be a good indication.
> For example alpine is 5mb, alpine with base utils is going to be more... You get the idea.

This installer size is illustrative and will take more space on disk (after unpacking), unless it's a live system.

For most OSes you will have to go through some basic documentation to get started.

But here we love to fail and bricj the install 50 times so let's proceed.
