## Distributions

We talk of ditributions but each distro has it's own releases types:
Often broken down into: 

Architecture Type & Installation type

Architectures means processor type.  
```
    amd64
    i386
    aarch64
    armv7
    powerpc
    powerpc64
    powerpc64le
    powerpcspe
    riscv64

VM Images, SD Card Images, etc
``` 

While the installation type is often the contents itself: Minimal, server, desktop, live environment, ... 
Hence why it's important to go some do some research for the type of project you are aiming to achieve.
